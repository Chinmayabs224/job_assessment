# Job Recommendation System

This project is a comprehensive job recommendation system designed to match job seekers with suitable job openings. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand resume content and job descriptions, providing relevant recommendations.

## Key Features

*   **Document Ingestion**: Supports ingestion of resumes and job descriptions from various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT), including OCR for image-based PDFs.
*   **Text Processing**: Advanced text cleaning, normalization, and extraction of key information (entities, keywords).
*   **Semantic Understanding**: Utilizes sentence embeddings (via Sentence Transformers) to capture the semantic meaning of text for accurate matching.
*   **Recommendation Engine**: Core engine calculates similarity between resumes and job descriptions to provide ranked recommendations.
*   **Modular Design**: Built with a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and integration of new models or components.
*   **API for Integration**: (Planned) A FastAPI-based API for serving recommendations and potentially other insights.
*   **Placeholder Models**: Includes placeholders for various analytical models like salary prediction, market segmentation, and job classification, which can be implemented to extend functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: `pytesseract` requires Tesseract OCR to be installed on your system. Please see the [Tesseract installation guide](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for instructions.*
    *On the first run, `spacy` and `sentence-transformers` might download necessary model files.*

## Basic Usage (Conceptual - to be implemented)

The core recommendation workflow will involve the following conceptual steps (a script `main_recommendation.py` will be provided to demonstrate this):

1.  **Prepare Data**: Place resumes and job descriptions in a designated sample data directory (e.g., `data/resumes/` and `data/job_descriptions/`).
2.  **Run Recommendation Script**: Execute the main script.
    ```bash
    python main_recommendation.py --resume_path data/resumes/my_resume.pdf --jobs_dir data/job_descriptions/
    ```
3.  **View Output**: The script will output the top job recommendations for the provided resume based on the available job descriptions.

Further details on API usage and model training will be added as those components are developed.
